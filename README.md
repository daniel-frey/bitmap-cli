# 04 - Bitmap Transformer for Python

Creation of a command bitmap file manipulation application for Python 401

# Version
- 0.0.1

# Feature Tasks

For this assignment you will be building a Bitmap (.bmp) transformer CLI. It will read a bitmap in from disk, run one or more color or pixel transforms and then write the newly transformed file data out to a new ```.bmp``` file.


# Running the Application

This is a command line driven program. Instructions to follow.

# Testing

All tests are written in PyTest - To run the tests make sure that pipenv is running ("pipenv shell"), and then install pytest ("pipenv install pytest"). Once that is finished, you may run the tests by simply typing "pytest" in the terminal.
